# Tableau Dashboard Guide for Churn Analysis

This guide provides a step-by-step procedure to visualize the `churn_dashboard_data.csv` file in Tableau. The goal is to create an interactive dashboard that helps identify at-risk customers and understand the drivers of churn.

## Prerequisites
- **Tableau Desktop** or **Tableau Public** installed.
- The **`churn_dashboard_data.csv`** file generated by the analysis script.

## Step 1: Connect to Data

1.  Open Tableau.
2.  Under **Connect**, select **Text file**.
3.  Navigate to your project folder and select `churn_dashboard_data.csv`.
4.  Verify the data is loaded correctly in the **Data Source** tab. Ensure numerical fields (like `Total Spend`, `Tenure`) are treated as Measures (green) and categorical fields (like `Risk Level`, `Gender`) are Dimensions (blue).

## Step 2: Create Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### KPI 1: Total Customers
1.  Create a new sheet named **"KPI - Total Customers"**.
5.  Edit the title to say "Predicted Churn Rate".

## Step 3: Create Visualizations

### Chart 1: Customer Risk Distribution
*Visualize how many customers fall into each risk category.*
1.  Create a new sheet named **"Risk Distribution"**.
2.  Drag `Risk_Level` to **Columns**.
3.  Drag `CustomerID` (Count Distinct) to **Rows**.
4.  Drag `Risk_Level` to **Color**.
5.  Manually adjust colors: **High Risk** (Red), **Medium Risk** (Orange), **Low Risk** (Green).
6.  Turn on labels by clicking the **"T"** icon in the toolbar.

### Chart 2: Churn Drivers - Support Calls vs. Payment Delay
*Analyze the top two factors contributing to churn.*
1.  Create a new sheet named **"Churn Drivers"**.
2.  Drag `Support Calls` to **Columns**. Right-click the pill and select **Dimension**.
3.  Drag `Payment Delay` to **Rows**. Right-click the pill and select **Dimension**.
4.  Change the mark type to **Circle**.
5.  Drag `Risk_Level` to **Color**.
6.  Drag `CustomerID` to **Size**. Right-click and select **Measure** -> **Count (Distinct)**.
7.  (Optional) In the **Color** card, reduce **Opacity** to 70% to see overlapping bubbles better.
8.  This bubble grid shows that customers with higher support calls and longer payment delays tend to be "High Risk".

### Chart 3: Churn by Subscription Type
*See which subscription tier has the highest churn.*
1.  Create a new sheet named **"Churn by Subscription"**.
2.  Drag `Subscription Type` to **Columns**.
3.  Drag `Predicted_Churn` to **Rows**.
4.  Change the aggregation of `Predicted_Churn` to **Average** (to show a percentage).
5.  Sort the bars descending.
6.  Drag `Subscription Type` to **Color** for better visuals.

### Chart 4: High Risk Customer List
*A detailed list for the support team to action.*
1.  Create a new sheet named **"High Risk List"**.
2.  Drag `Risk_Level` to the **Filters** shelf and select only **"High Risk"**.
    - **Bottom**: Drag `Churn by Subscription` and `High Risk List`.
4.  **Interactivity (Make it Clickable)**:
    - Go to the top menu bar: **Dashboard** > **Actions**.
    - Click **Add Action** > **Filter**.
    - **Name**: "Filter by Risk Level".
    - **Source Sheets**: Select only **"Risk Distribution"**. This is the chart you will click on.
    - **Target Sheets**: Select all other charts (KPIs, Churn Drivers, High Risk List). These are the charts that will change.
    - **Run action on**: Select **Select**. This means the filter activates when you click a bar.
    - **Clearing the selection will**: Select **Show all values**. This means if you click the bar again (deselect), the dashboard goes back to showing everyone.
    - **Why do this?** This allows you to click the red "High Risk" bar, and immediately see *only* high-risk customers in the list and see *only* their specific churn drivers.

## Step 5: Polish and Publish

1.  **Add a Title**:
    - Check the **Show Title** box in the bottom left of the Dashboard pane.
    - Double-click the title at the top of the dashboard.
    - Change it to **"Customer Retention Dashboard"**. Make it font size 24 and Bold.
2.  **Clean Up**:
    - Right-click the titles of individual charts (like "Risk Distribution") and select **Hide Title** if they are obvious. This gives more space to the data.
3.  **Enhance Tooltips (Fixing Missing Values)**:
    - Go to the **"Churn Drivers"** sheet.
    - **Crucial Step**: You cannot just type `<AVG(Total Spend)>`. You must **drag the fields** to the Tooltip card first.
    - Drag `Total Spend` to the **Tooltip** square on the Marks card. Right-click it and select **Measure** > **Average**.
    - Drag `Tenure` to the **Tooltip** square. Right-click it and select **Measure** > **Average**.
    - Now, click the **Tooltip** button to edit.
    - Click the **Insert** button in the top right of the dialog and select the fields you just added.
    - It should look like: `Total Spend: <AVG(Total Spend)>`.
    - **Why?** Tableau only knows how to display data that is present on the Marks card.
4.  **Save Your Work**:
    - **File** > **Save As**.
    - **Filename**: `Customer_Retention_Dashboard` (or `Churn_Analysis_Insights`).
    - **File Type**: Choose **Tableau Packaged Workbook (*.twbx)**.
    - **Important**: Saving as `.twbx` saves the data *inside* the file, so you can send it to others and it will still work.
