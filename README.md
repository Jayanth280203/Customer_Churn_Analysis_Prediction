# Churn Analysis & Prediction

This project provides a complete workflow for analyzing and predicting customer churn. It includes tools for generating synthetic data, training a machine learning model, and exporting results for further analysis or dashboarding.

## Project Structure

- **`data_generator.py`**: A script to generate synthetic customer data. It creates a dataset with features like Age, Gender, Tenure, Usage Frequency, Support Calls, Payment Delay, etc., and simulates a `Churn` target variable based on logical rules.
- **`churn_analysis.py`**: The main analysis script. It performs the following steps:
    1.  **Preprocessing**: Cleans data, encodes categorical variables, and scales features.
    2.  **Modeling**: Trains a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn.
    3.  **Evaluation**: Prints accuracy and a classification report.
    4.  **Feature Importance**: Calculates and plots the most important features driving churn.
    5.  **Export**: Generates a new CSV file (`churn_dashboard_data.csv`) containing the original data plus predicted churn probabilities and risk levels (Low, Medium, High).
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or ensure all files are in the same directory.
2.  **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### 1. Generate Data
First, generate the synthetic dataset. This will create `customer_churn_data.csv`.

```bash
python data_generator.py
```

### 2. Run Analysis
Run the analysis script to train the model and generate insights.

```bash
python churn_analysis.py
```

## Outputs

After running the scripts, you will find the following output files:

- **`customer_churn_data.csv`**: The raw input data generated by `data_generator.py`.
- **`feature_importance.png`**: A bar chart visualizing the top features that contribute to customer churn.
- **`churn_dashboard_data.csv`**: A comprehensive dataset ready for dashboard tools (like Tableau, PowerBI, or Streamlit). It includes:
    - Original customer data.
    - `Churn_Probability`: The model's estimated probability of churn (0 to 1).
    - `Predicted_Churn`: The binary prediction (0 or 1).
    - `Risk_Level`: A categorical risk assessment ('Low Risk', 'Medium Risk', 'High Risk').

## Key Insights
The model identifies key drivers of churn such as **Payment Delay**, **Support Calls**, and **Total Spend**. The generated dashboard data allows for targeted intervention strategies based on customer risk profiles.
